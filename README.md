# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
a) This is the process of building, maintaining and testing software.
b) used to ship software that solve day-to-day problems a good example is a bus booking application. Which solves traditional way people used to book buses, but now they can do that on single button tap on their devices

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a) Rise of agile methodologies
b) introduction of OOP(object oriented programming)
c) intruduction to structured programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Planing
b) Designing and coding
c) Testing
d) Deployment
e) Maintanance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
a) Watefall method, there is a followed procedure, one step has to be completed inorder to move to the other step. The project is not broken down into smaller task's. When working on a simple project, waterfall is most suitable since the procedures are less and well stated
b) Agile method, the project is broken down into smaller managable tasks. This is because agile is itarative and enable flexibility. When working on a more complex project, Agile method is the most suitable, because of how iterative it is the project is broken down to smaller parts that can be worked on.On agile flexibility this allows updates while still working.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a) Software delveloper - Build, test and deploys the software.
b) QualityAssuarance Engineer - Test the software to make sure that it meets the requirements of what is expected of the software
c) Project Manager - oversees the project to make sure it is what is expected, sets the budget for the project and delivered within the expected time/period

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
a) Integrated Development - This are tools like(VisualStudio, jetsBrains) that are used to provide a suitable programming environment for developers to work on a project.
b) Version control software - a good example is git,Which basically keeps tracks of project files, basically used to keep controll of changes made on local repository(project files) and update those changes to the remote repostitory online on github.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a) Technical Complexity - with time technologies keep on changing, so as a software developer it is good to keep on learning these new technologies
b) Code quantity and maintainability - Writing and maintaing code is challenging for some developers to overcome this, one can adapt to best code practices, regular code reviews and setting up test cases for the code
c) Project management and deadlines - Meeting deadlines while maintaining code quality can be an herculean task if not properly strategised, to overcome this one can break the project into smaller tasks and collaboration with the team to keep them up to date.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a) unit testing - This is the process of testing single components or unit of a software to make sure they work as expected. At this stage is where defect(a detected problem) is noticed and can be highleted to be fixed , also helps in writing code documentition
b) integration testing - This is the process of testing different interactions between units and modules in a software application.  Ensures dataflow between the modules is as expected, checks if the system is stable even after module intergration
c) system testing - This is the testing done on the full software application. Why system testing is done? to make sure that the product meets users requirement, identifies vulnerbilities and makes sure the software is user friendly
d) acceptance testing - This is the final testing that determines that the software is compatible to be released to the market. It is done to make sure that the software meets the end-user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
a) Prompt engineering -  This is the process of crafting and refining instruction that directs an ai model to produce specific and accurate data based on prompts.
b) Importance of Prompt engineering - Ensures that the data returned is accurate, Mitigating risk and ethical considerations, Adaptive learning for the ai model and improved user experience

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
a) vague prompt - write about the government, improved prompt - write an explanation on what is the government, how it works and used
b) The impoved promompt exactly tells the model what kind of content(government and how it works) it should focus on generating, This reduces the ambiguity of the prompt making the model understand much better what it is expected to look for.
